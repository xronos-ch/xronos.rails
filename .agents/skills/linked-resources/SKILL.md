## What I do
- Document the polymorphic `LinkedResource` model and its `linked_resources` table
- Document the `LinkedResource::Source` registry and the per-source configuration pattern
- Document the `Linkable` concern and the `linkable_to` macro
- Document the `BatchMatchableToWikidata` concern as the canonical pattern for SPARQL-based enrichment
- Document the canonical testing strategy (test source + parameterized real-source coverage, no per-source parallel host classes)
- Flag the async-enrichment principle: XRONOS never blocks user-facing actions on external services

## When to use me
Use this when:
- Adding a new linked-data source (Pleiades, Vici.org, OpenContext, iDAI, etc.)
- Wiring the linkable macro into a new model (C14, Context, …)
- Refactoring the linked_resources form to be source-selectable
- Writing or debugging a rake task / background job that enriches records from an external API
- Debugging the curation dashboard nav, badges, or per-source scopes

## The architecture, in three pieces

```

The three pieces are independent:
- `LinkedResource` is the storage model — doesn't know about specific sources.
- `LinkedResource::Source` is the registry — knows per-source config, doesn't know about models.
- `Linkable` is the per-host concern — generates per-source methods, looks up sources by name.

## Data model

`LinkedResource` is a **polymorphic** join to any model. The `linkable_type` / `linkable_id` columns store the parent. The class column (`source`) and the id column (`external_id`) identify the linked-data entity.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `linkable_type` | string | e.g. `"Site"` |
| `linkable_id` | bigint | parent's id |
| `source` | string | must match a registered `LinkedResource::Source#name` (validated) |
| `external_id` | string | the source's id, stored as-is (e.g. `"Q123456"` for Wikidata) |
| `status` | string | `"pending"` (default) or `"approved"` |
| `data` | jsonb | optional metadata cached from the source (label, description, …) |

**Source id is stored and printed as-is.** Do not prefix/suffix at display time; validate the full format via `LinkedResource::Source#id_pattern`.

## Naming conventions

Per AGENTS.md:

| Layer | Where | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Per-source registry PORO | `app/models/<model>/source.rb` (nested) | `LinkedResource::Source` |
| Per-source concern | `app/models/concerns/batch_matchable_to_<source>.rb` | `BatchMatchableToWikidata` |
| Host concern | `app/models/concerns/linkable.rb` | `Linkable` |

A new source typically needs only the registry entry. The `Linkable` macro picks it up automatically — no per-source methods to write. A matching concern (`BatchMatchableToPleiades`, etc.) is only needed if the source has an enrichment flow that warrants its own SPARQL/API logic.

## The registry: `LinkedResource::Source`

A PORO nested under `LinkedResource` (per the PORO-under-AR convention). Holds the per-source configuration.

**Each known source is a separate file** at `app/models/linked_resource/sources/<key>.rb`, defining a module `LinkedResource::Sources::<KeyCamelized>` that exposes an `ATTRIBUTES` constant (a frozen hash) **and calls `Source.register` at the bottom** to register itself when Zeitwerk loads the file. The `LinkedResource` model keeps a `KNOWN_SOURCES` whitelist that triggers the load (via `const_get`) and then asserts each source actually registered — so a missing or misbehaving source module fails loudly at class-load time rather than silently at use-time. The class body re-evaluates on every Zeitwerk reload, so the registry is repopulated in development without a separate `to_prepare` / `after_initialize` hook.

Pleiades (no brand logo) is a representative example:

```ruby
# app/models/linked_resource/sources/pleiades.rb
class LinkedResource
  module Sources
    module Pleiades
      ATTRIBUTES = {
        name: "Pleiades",
        url_template: "https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/%<id>s",
        id_pattern: /\A\d+\z/,
        has_logo: false,
        description: "Pleiades place resource"
      }.freeze

      LinkedResource::Source.register(:pleiades, **ATTRIBUTES)
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/linked_resource.rb
class LinkedResource < ApplicationRecord
  KNOWN_SOURCES = %i[wikidata pleiades vici].freeze
  KNOWN_SOURCES.each do |key|
    Sources.const_get(key.to_s.camelize)
    next if Source.known?(key.to_s)

    raise "Known source :#{key} is not registered. Check that " \
      "app/models/linked_resource/sources/#{key}.rb defines module " \
      "LinkedResource::Sources::#{key.to_s.camelize} and calls " \
      "LinkedResource::Source.register(#{key.inspect}, **ATTRIBUTES)."
  end
  # ...
end
```

`id_prefix` is **not** a thing — ids are stored as the user sees them. The `url_template` interpolates the full id via `%<id>s` (or `%{id}`, both work via `Kernel#format`).

**Registry API** (in `app/models/linked_resource/source.rb`):
- `LinkedResource::Source.register(:key, **attrs)` — register
- `LinkedResource::Source.find(name_or_key)` — by `"Pleiades"` (name) or `:pleiades` (key); returns `nil` if unknown
- `LinkedResource::Source.known?(name)` — boolean
- `LinkedResource::Source.all` — array of all registered
- `LinkedResource::Source.reset!` — for tests
- Instance: `source.url_for(id)`, `source.valid_id?(id)`, `source.has_logo?` (true by default; false for sources that fall back to a letter icon — see "Icons" below)

## Icons: logo SVG or letter fallback

The icon for a source is rendered by the `linked_resource_icon(source_name)` helper in `app/helpers/linked_resources_helper.rb`. Two paths:

- **Has a logo SVG** (`has_logo: true`, the default): the source's `icon` attribute is a SimpleIcons slug, and the helper renders `simple_icon(slug)`, which embeds the SVG at `app/assets/images/simple_icons/<slug>.svg`. Example: Wikidata → `simple_icon "wikidata"`.
- **No logo** (`has_logo: false`): the helper falls back to a Bootstrap Icons letter-circle built from the first letter of the source's name — `bs_icon "#{name.first.downcase}-circle"`. Example: Pleiades → `bs_icon "p-circle"`. The Bootstrap Icons `*-circle` alphabet is available for every letter, so the fallback works for any future source without a brand logo (Pleiades, Vici.org, OpenContext, iDAI, …).

## The `Linkable` concern

`Linkable` is mixed into any model that can have linked resources. The `linkable_to` macro generates per-source shortcut methods from the registry.

```ruby
class Site < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :linked_resources, as: :linkable, dependent: :destroy

  include Linkable
  linkable_to :wikidata          # one line per source
end
```

`linkable_to :wikidata` generates:
- `Site#wikidata_link` — reader for the LinkedResource
- `Site#missing_wikidata_link?` / `Site#pending_wikidata_link?` — predicates
- `Site.missing_wikidata_link` / `Site.pending_wikidata_link` — scopes
- Registers both issue symbols in `Site.linked_resource_issues` (the class-level array)

Adding Pleiades is a one-liner (`linkable_to :pleiades`); all the per-source methods appear automatically.

## ⛔ The async enrichment principle (CRITICAL)

**XRONOS must never be blocked by, or made reliant on, an external request.** External services (Wikidata, Pleiades, Geocoder, GBIF, Wikipedia, Nominatim, …) are **enrichment layers**. They add value; they must never gate a user action.

Three concrete rules:

1. **Enrichment produces pending records, not synchronous data.** The site show page never makes a SPARQL call. `BatchMatchableToWikidata.wikidata_match_candidates_batch` creates `LinkedResource` records with `status: "pending"` and stores the suggestion in `data`. The user (curator) reviews and approves later. The page is fast and works offline.

2. **Heavy enrichment runs in background jobs.** `Site::FetchDescriptionJob` pre-warms the `Site::Description` cache so the first request to the lazy turbo-frame hits a warm cache. Cache TTL is 7 days. Never call a Wikimedia / Wikidata / GBIF / Geocoder API synchronously from a controller action.

3. **Errors are silent, not fatal.** A SPARQL timeout, a GBIF 500, a Geocoder failure — all return empty / null. The user sees a record with no enrichment, not a 500 page. `BatchMatchableToWikidata` rescues `Net::OpenTimeout`, `Net::ReadTimeout`, `SocketError` and returns an empty hash.

When writing any new external-service integration:
- Ask: "what happens to the user if this endpoint is down for a week?" If the answer is "they can't use the app", you have a problem.
- Wrap every HTTP call in a rescue returning a safe default.
- Set a short timeout (≤ 5s) so a slow service doesn't hold up a worker.
- Use `Rails.cache` to memoize external responses; default TTL ≥ 1 day.
- If a record needs to be enriched on user-visible display, do it once at save and store the result. Never fetch on every request.

## Adding a new source: worked example (Pleiades)

Most sources need only steps 1–2. Add a concern only if you need SPARQL/API enrichment.

1. **Create a source module** at `app/models/linked_resource/sources/<key>.rb` (e.g. `pleiades.rb`). The filename is the source key in lowercase; the module name is the camelized form. The module exposes an `ATTRIBUTES` hash and **calls `Source.register` at the bottom** to register itself when loaded. Set `has_logo: false` if the source has no brand logo (see "Icons" above); set `icon: "<simpleicons-slug>"` (and `has_logo: true`, the default) if it does.

   ```ruby
   # app/models/linked_resource/sources/pleiades.rb
   class LinkedResource
     module Sources
       module Pleiades
         ATTRIBUTES = {
           name: "Pleiades",
           url_template: "https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/%<id>s",
           id_pattern: /\A\d+\z/,
           has_logo: false,
           description: "Pleiades place resource"
         }.freeze

         LinkedResource::Source.register(:pleiades, **ATTRIBUTES)
       end
     end
   end
   ```
2. **Add the key** to `LinkedResource::KNOWN_SOURCES` in `app/models/linked_resource.rb`. The model iterates this list to trigger each source's load and then asserts the registration actually happened. Forgetting the `Source.register` call (or getting the key wrong) will raise a loud error at class-load time, not at use-time.
3. **Add `linkable_to :pleiades`** to the host model (e.g. `Site`). This generates `pleiades_link`, `missing_pleiades_link?`, `pending_pleiades_link?`, the corresponding scopes, and registers the issue symbols so the per-site view and curation dashboard auto-populate.
4. **If the source has a logo** (the default path), add the SimpleIcons SVG at `app/assets/images/simple_icons/<key>.svg` (lowercase key). If `has_logo: false`, the `linked_resource_icon` helper falls back to a Bootstrap letter-circle — no asset to add.
5. **Test it** — no per-source parallel coverage. The macro and registry are tested once with a test source (see "Testing strategy" below); real sources are covered by parameterized tests that iterate `KNOWN_SOURCES`. Add a new source: (a) append the key to `KNOWN_SOURCES`, (b) add a `(name, id, expected_url)` row to the URL-templates test, (c) optionally add the host-model's `linkable_to` line. The site page's "Add {source} link" button and the missing/pending badges appear automatically; no view changes needed.

## Testing strategy

The registry, the macro, and the per-source attributes are tested in **two layers** that are deliberately non-overlapping. Adding a new source should not add per-source parallel coverage; the canonical tests already cover the macro, and the real-source tests already cover all sources by iterating.

### Layer 1: canonical tests with a test source (one source, full coverage)

The macro and registry are generic — they don't care about Wikidata vs. Pleiades vs. Vici.org. So the canonical tests use a **test source** registered in the test file itself, not a real source. This isolates the tests from any external service and makes them self-documenting.

**Registry tests** (`test/models/linked_resource/source_test.rb`):
- Register a `:source_test` source in `setup` with the full set of attributes (`name`, `url_template`, `id_pattern`, `icon`, `description`).
- Exercise every method of the registry API: `register`, `find`, `known?`, `all`, `reset!`, plus the PORO methods `url_for`, `valid_id?`, `has_logo?`.
- The teardown removes the source so it doesn't leak into other tests.
- These 13-ish tests cover the registry fully. New source files don't need their own registry tests.

**Macro tests** (`test/models/concerns/linkable_test.rb`):
- Register the test source **at the top of the file** (before the class definition) so the test host class can use `linkable_to :source_test` at class-definition time. Also re-register in `setup` because `source_test.rb`'s teardown removes the source from the registry, and `LinkedResource`'s validation looks the source up in the registry at validation time.
- Define a single `LinkableTestHost` with `linkable_to :source_test`. The macro generates `source_test_link`, `missing_source_test_link?`, `pending_source_test_link?`, the two scopes, and registers the two issue symbols.
- All macro tests (reader, predicates, scopes, issue registration, unknown-source error) use this single host class.
- These 13-ish tests cover the macro fully. New source files don't need their own test host classes.

### Layer 2: parameterized real-source coverage (loop, not per-source tests)

Real source files (`app/models/linked_resource/sources/*.rb`) are thin — just an `ATTRIBUTES` hash and a `Source.register` call. Configuration typos (wrong URL template, wrong key) are caught by two small tests in `source_test.rb` that iterate:

```ruby
test 'all KNOWN_SOURCES are registered at boot' do
  LinkedResource::KNOWN_SOURCES.each do |key|
    assert LinkedResource::Source.known?(key.to_s),
      "Source :#{key} is in KNOWN_SOURCES but not registered"
  end
end

test 'known sources have expected URL templates' do
  {
    'Wikidata' => [ 'Q123', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123' ],
    'Pleiades' => [ '687917', 'https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687917' ],
    'Vici.org' => [ '57205', 'https://vici.org/vici/57205/' ]
  }.each do |name, (id, expected_url)|
    assert_equal expected_url, LinkedResource::Source.find(name).url_for(id),
      "URL template for #{name} should produce #{expected_url}"
  end
end
```

When you add a source, add one row to the URL-templates hash. The "all known sources are registered" test picks up the new source automatically from `KNOWN_SOURCES` — no edit needed.

### Why not per-source parallel coverage?

The macro is pure string interpolation (`"#{key}_link"`, `scope "missing_#{key}_link"`, etc.). Testing it with `:wikidata` proves it works for `:pleiades` and `:vici` and every future source. A separate test host class per source runs the same code path with a different key — it's repetition, not coverage.

Configuration typos (wrong URL, wrong regex) are caught by:
- App boot: the `KNOWN_SOURCES` loop in `LinkedResource` raises if a source file is missing or doesn't register.
- Code review: the source file is ~20 lines.
- The two parameterized tests above.

None of these are silent failures that only a per-source test would catch.

### When to deviate

Add a per-source test only when the source's behavior is genuinely source-specific and not exercised by the canonical tests. Examples that *would* justify a per-source test:
- A non-trivial `id_pattern` (e.g. something more nuanced than `/\A\d+\z/` — add boundary cases).
- A source that overrides macro behavior (none today, but possible if `Linkable` grows per-source hooks).
- A `BatchMatchableTo*` concern with source-specific SPARQL/API logic (the existing `BatchMatchableToWikidata` has its own tests).

A simple integer pattern, a `url_template`, a `has_logo` flag — none of these warrant a per-source test. The parameterized coverage is enough.

## The curation dashboard — Wikidata-only by design

The `LinkedResources::SitesController` dashboard (mounted at `/linked_resources/sites/:issue`) is currently Wikidata-only. Adding per-source dashboards is a separate decision; the data is already there (`Site.linked_resource_issues` is the array of every registered source's issue symbols). Talk to the user before exposing per-source views — they may want a per-source nav, a combined view, or neither.

## The `BatchMatchableToWikidata` pattern (template for new enrichments)

If a new source has an enrichment flow (e.g. matching C14s to Pleiades, finding Vici.org references by name), model it on `BatchMatchableToWikidata`:

- New concern `app/models/concerns/batch_matchable_to_<source>.rb`
- Class methods: `<source>_match_candidates_batch(records)` and helpers
- Constants: `USER_AGENT` (use `Xronos::USER_AGENT`), `<SOURCE>_<THING>_WIKIDATA_ID` (or similar)
- The `execute_*_request` method sets short timeouts (≤ 5s) and rescues network errors
- The match candidates method **only creates pending records** — never updates existing ones, never makes blocking writes the user is waiting on
- Models include the concern: `include BatchMatchableToPleiades` and add `linkable_to :pleiades`

## Common pitfalls
- Do not synchronously call external services in controllers or views.
- Do not block user-visible pages on external response time. If a controller or view needs enriched data, pre-warm it in a job.
- Do not prefix or strip the source id at display time. Store and print the full id (e.g. `Q123456`).
- Do not add per-source methods to the host model by hand. Use `linkable_to :source` so the macro generates them.
- Do not create a `WikidataLink`, `PleiadesLink`, etc. model. Use the polymorphic `LinkedResource` with `source: "Pleiades"`.
- Do not store ontology URLs in columns. The source registry is the single source of truth for URL templates.
- Do not `find_or_create_by!` a `LinkedResource` on the user's hot path. It's fine in a job; it's not fine in a controller.
- Do not use the `wikidata_link_attributes` strong-params key. There is no `WikidataLink` model.

## File map

- `app/models/linked_resource/source.rb` — the registry PORO
- `app/models/linked_resource/sources/` — one file per known source, each defining a module under `LinkedResource::Sources::<KeyCamelized>` with an `ATTRIBUTES` constant
- `app/models/concerns/linkable.rb` — the `linkable_to` macro
- `app/models/concerns/batch_matchable_to_wikidata.rb` — SPARQL enrichment for Wikidata
- `app/models/site/description.rb` — lazy Wikipedia + Wikimedia images, cached 7 days
- `app/jobs/site/fetch_description_job.rb` — pre-warms the description cache
- `app/controllers/linked_resources_controller.rb` — CRUD
- `app/controllers/linked_resources/sites_controller.rb` — curation dashboard
- `app/views/linked_resources/` — CRUD and curation views
- `app/helpers/linked_resources_helper.rb` — `linked_resource_icon` (logo SVG or letter-circle fallback), `linked_resource_badge` (issue badge)
- `lib/xronos.rb` — `Xronos::USER_AGENT`, `Xronos::CONTACT_EMAIL`
- `test/models/linked_resource_test.rb`

## Maintaining this skill
If you add a new source, refactor `LinkedResource` or `LinkedResource::Source`, change the `linkable_to` macro, or add a new `BatchMatchableTo*` concern, **update this skill file** so future agents use the correct patterns. The async-enrichment principle is non-negotiable — if you're tempted to relax it, talk to the user first.
