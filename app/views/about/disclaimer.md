The copyright for any material created by the author is reserved.

## Privacy policy

If the opportunity for the input of personal or business data (email addresses, name, addresses) is given, the input of these data takes place voluntarily. Users retain full sovereignty over their scientific data that will be fully encrypted in such a way that even the database administrators have no insight into the data. Each individual user has an encrypted key-store in which the public keys for individual data to which they have access are stored. Using these keys, the individual data records, which are encrypted in turn, can then be decrypted and used. The “public user” is created like any other user, and the keys registered for this user are automatically included for all other users. In this way it is ensured that individual users can make their own data available either to individual other users or to the general public, and by accessing the database alone without the corresponding keys for the key storesno access to the data can be gained, not even by the database administrators.

Data, especially personal date deserving particular protection, which you send to the Xronos database via contact formular or e-mail, will be treated strictly confidential and only used in the context, you sent it. However, please notice that sending contact forms or e-mails is not secure normally and data can be intercepted by unauthorised third parties (hackers). Therefore, the Xronos database recommends to send personal data deserving particular protection not via e-mail, or, if you do, check beforehand whether the data is transmitted via a secured transmission protocol.
