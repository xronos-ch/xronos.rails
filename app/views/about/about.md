# What is XRONOS?

XRONOS is an open access online database for absolute chronological archaeological information. Designed in the spirit of open science, XRONOS is the first overarching database that compiles, manages and provides 14C- and dendrochronological dates for scholars worldwide. At the same time the privacy of the contributors and their full control over their data disclosers are guaranteed by licensing.

Research on the past today can no longer gain knowledge about human-environmental processes like social, cultural, economic and climatic transformations without scientific temporal information. Therefore, XRONOS provides users not only to store and share their data but also aims at making large amounts of data accessible for data driven powerful methods like the modelling time series and chronologies.

While there are no spatial or temporal restrictions, the database currently comprises datings and corresponding metadata of prehistoric Europe form the Neolithic as well as Bronze and Early Iron Ages mainly. Search options allow the selection of dates based on time by BCE an BP scales, map- and variable-based spatial ones from Counties to archaeological structure feature types but also further metadata like dating methods, sample materials etc. Dendro-data is currently only complied in the form of fell-phases, with the prospect of collecting individual measurements in the future. For 14C-dates online single and summed calibrations are possible, while further analytical functions shall be included later on.

The data and related information were taken from the literature cited in each case, as well as already existing other databases. Data contributions are [listed here](/about/acknowledgements). If you would like to contribute your own data or help us to improve XRONOS we would be grateful.
